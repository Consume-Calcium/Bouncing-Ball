# Bouncing-Ball
## Supplementary material for solo investigations "Bouncing Ball" project

- ### ([**Bouncing Ball Basic.py**](https://github.com/Consume-Calcium/Bouncing-Ball/blob/main/Bouncing%20Ball%20Basic.py)) Code for determining the trajectory of a particle bouncing off a single large sphere
- ### ([**Bouncing Ball Lattice**](https://github.com/Consume-Calcium/Bouncing-Ball/blob/main/Bouncing%20Ball%20Lattice.py)) Code for estimating the electron mobilities in various metals using a generalised version of the basic code for spheres arranged in a lattice and a Monte-Carlo simulation
- ### ([**Comparison.py**](https://github.com/Consume-Calcium/Bouncing-Ball/blob/main/Comparison.py)) Code for comparing estimated values of electron mobilities with experimentally measured values
